## 🎮 Project Overview

**Cupcake Pursuit** is a maze chase game currently in early development, built upon the **[MonoGame StartKit VB.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PacDessert1436.MonoGame.StartKitVB/)** template (version 1.2.7) - a NuGet package created by the project owner specifically for MonoGame VB.NET development.

The game concept follows a baker's quest to collect cupcake ingredients while evading enemies in a vibrant, maze-based environment.

### Current Development Progress
- **Title Card Artwork**: Draft completed (color palette and decorative elements pending finalization)
- **Core Framework**: Utilizes the MonoGame StartKit VB.NET template with its demo game logic
- **Control System**: Gamepad, keyboard, and virtual joystick support (as provided by the template)

> **Note**: At this stage, only the title card artwork has been customized. All other game logic and assets remain unchanged from the MonoGame StartKit VB.NET demo.
